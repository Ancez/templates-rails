# Templates
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/templates-rails.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/templates-rails)
[![Rspec](https://github.com/Ancez/templates-rails/actions/workflows/rspec.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ancez/templates-rails/actions/workflows/rspec.yml)

Simple to use templating system for your Rails application. Design your views before implementation.

## Installation

Add follow line to your Gemfile under the `:development` group and run `bundle install`

```ruby
gem 'templates-rails'
```

Or install it yourself as:

    gem install templates-rails --group development


## Setup

All configuration can go in an initializer (e.g. `config/initializers/templates.rb`) or in an environment file like `config/environments/development.rb`. All options have sensible defaults — set only what you need to change.

```ruby
# Parent controller for Templates::TemplatesController. Default: 'ApplicationController'.
# Change this for tenant-based apps or when you don't have an ApplicationController
# (e.g. set to 'ActionController::Base').
Templates.parent_controller = 'ApplicationController'

# Path the engine mounts at. Default: '/templates'.
Templates.mount_at = '/admin/styleguide'

# Directory under app/views/ that the engine reads templates from. Default: 'templates'.
# Set this to point the engine at an existing views tree without moving files.
Templates.views_path = 'admin/styleguide'

# When true (default) the engine auto-mounts at `Templates.mount_at`. Set to false to
# mount manually in your routes.rb — useful when you only want the styleguide
# available locally, or want to mount it inside a scope/constraint.
Templates.auto_mount = false
```

If you set `auto_mount = false`, mount the engine yourself. A common pattern is
to expose the styleguide only in development and test:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
mount Templates::Engine => '/admin/styleguide' if Rails.env.local?
```

## TODO
- Finish the install rake task to generate the `templates` directory
- Setup a rake task for generating the layouts so users can pick their layouts
- Finish the specs

## Usage
- `partials` directories get ignored within the `views/templates` directory

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
